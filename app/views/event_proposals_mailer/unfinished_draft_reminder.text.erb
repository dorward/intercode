Hi there!  Just a reminder: you started a proposal for "#{@event_proposal.title}"
on #{@event_proposal.created_at.to_s(:date_only_with_weekday)}, but haven't submitted it to
#{@event_proposal.convention.name} yet.

If you'd like to finish your proposal, go to:
#{event_proposal_url_for_convention(@event_proposal)}

This is a one-time reminder.  We won't remind you about this proposal again.
